# Project-3
Attack, Defense &amp; Analysis of a Vulnerable Network

Unit Description Scenario: 
In this project, I was acting as a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. The SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the security engineering team to investigate and confirm that newly created alerts are working.

If the alerts are working, I would then monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system. Then, I would report back my findings to the manager with appropriate analysis.
